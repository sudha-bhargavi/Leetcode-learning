Insertion and deletion is O(1)
Searching is O(N)

Tricks:
----------------------------------
Adding dummy node will help for many edge case and it will remain at header pointer. 
This will be helpful for merging linked list and add two binary numbers kind of problems.

For deletion in linked lists, you can either modify the node values or change the node pointers. You might need to keep a reference to the previous element.

For partitioning linked lists, create two separate linked lists and join them back together.

Two pointer approaches are also common for linked lists. For example:

Getting the kth from last node - Have two pointers, where one is k nodes ahead of the other. When the node ahead reaches the end, the other node is k nodes behind
Detecting cycles - Have two pointers, where one pointer increments twice as much as the other, if the two pointers meet, means that there is a cycle
Getting the middle node - Have two pointers, where one pointer increments twice as much as the other. When the faster node reaches the end of the list, the slower node will be at the middle
